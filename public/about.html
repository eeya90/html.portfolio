<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm someone who thinks they can do anything then attempt to do it all over the course of 2 weeks, fail, give up, forget about it, then randomly be struck by "ooh, remember THAT?" 2 years later.</p>

<p>Things you should know, probably:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I am a dumbass</li>
  <li>I currently have a rash</li>
  <li>and it itches</li>
  <li>Two cats</li>
  <li>Garbage on my desk</li>
  <li>I'm tired</li>
</ul>

<p>Hehe bye</p>
