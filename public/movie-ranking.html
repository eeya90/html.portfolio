<h1>The movies Andreea remembers well enough to describe</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies according to weak memory</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Big Fish</h3>
<p>I have watched this as a teen and thought it was clever. The way the story is told is whimsical and it's a love story that keeps on giving.</p>

<h3>Four Rooms</h3>
<p>Four Rooms is perhaps Tarantino's only good movie. It's a fine blend of "this is the worst movie I've ever seen" and "I've already watched this 7 times and can't get enough of it". At a certain point, you'll stop feeling sorry for the main character and start to question whether you're a diabolical piece of shit, as you begin to actually enjoy seeing the man suffer at the cost of his own arrogance.</p>

<h3>Shrek (all of them)</h3>
<p>This one does not need explaining, it's just very good. Way ahead of its time.</p>
